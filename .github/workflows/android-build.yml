The job is failing because the directory /home/runner/work/WizLightsOff/WizLightsOff/WizLightsOff/.buildozer/android/platform/python-for-android is not found. The solution involves ensuring that the required directories are created before the build process. Below is the updated workflow file to address this issue:

This workflow ensures the necessary directories are created if they do not exist, thereby preventing the FileNotFoundError during the build process.
